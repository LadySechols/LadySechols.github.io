    <p>Jeremy was a complicated man. He was a very fun loving person but also very stingy. Ask the man for a dollar and you are then his worst enemy. He had done many things in his life up to this point of our story. He defended his country, loved many times, was hurt in love many times, on many occasions his family hurt him for who he is. He fought to better himself, he fights to help his family better themselves. Jeremy was able to better his career. He married a beautiful woman, bought a large house he hopes to fill up with his own little family. Who is Jeremy and can you help him better his life or make it worse?</p>

    <p>Jeremy had a choice to continue as he has, living off his earned monthly money or go to college. This is one choice you cannot make for him. He already did for himself. Jeremy chose to go to college and get a degree. A lucrative degree in computer programming. Never in his life has he ever done anything so extreme against his natural, predictable ways.</p>

    <p>Jeremy met a girl, woman, female human. She is young and vibrant with a strong personality. She was brought up by two very strong, intelligent women. How was she every to be anything but like her moms? Ashley was working at a bar when she met Jeremy. These two were made for each other some would say. Jeremy managed to better her life while she bettered his. Ashley is a few years younger than Jeremy, but age does not determine who you are. A few hardships in the relationship nearly tore them apart. There were things in Jeremy's past that Ashley almost could not accept. Ashley made Jeremy feel very little, small, a nothing compared with who he really is. Jeremy was patient and waited for the shock of his dark past subside so that she could really reflect on the subject.</p>

    <p>See, Jeremy waited to long in the relationship to share his unknown past situation with Ashley. She grew to care for him and love him. Once she felt this way Jeremy decided then to inform her of all that he was. <em>If it were up to me at this point I would have chosen for Jeremy to tell Ashley his dark secrets before the whole was dug too deep.</em>Ashley, felt that Jeremy was worth more than his past, but that doesn't change how she made Jeremy feel when she learned of his past. She made his feel like garbage. Damage like that from someone you care about does not go away. He eats you alive until you feel nothing, or you can overcome it. Jeremy could not overcome it.</p>

    <p>Just a couple years later the two got married. Ashley moved up in the world from bar tender to finance manager at some unimportant business. <em>We don't really care about Ashley's job, at least not yet anyway.</em>The two married quietly but fashionably. Jeremy looked very handsome in his black tuxedo. Ashley looked equally radiant in her white form fitting dress. A photographer was rented to take many professional photos of their special day. A limousine was rented to luxury and a sense of importance.</p>

    <p>Did Jeremy marry Ashley as she wanted to marry and with such extravagance to show her that he is really more than she made him feel? Did Ashley want so many expense, useless things, for an elopement to punish Jeremy for hurting her confidence? Is this any way to start a marriage? Is this any way to continue a relationship?</p>

    <p>For these two "love birds" their answer was yes.</p>

    <p>Half a million dollar house later with many more rooms than the two need, they settled into their first home together as a married couple. </p>
